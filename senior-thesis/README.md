# Logic via Algebra
My senior thesis written in the Fall of 2012 at Kenyon College, under the guidance of Dr. Robert Milnikel.

## abstract
The purpose of this paper is to gain insight to mathematical logic through
an algebraic perspective. Although readers with a working knowledge of
mathematical logic will see very familiar concepts, the only prerequisite to
this paper is an undergraduate level course in abstract algebra. We begin
by defining a propositional language and proving a few simple theorems,
to be followed by an introduction to boolean algebra and its consistency
with the propositional calculus. We will then show how common notions in
propositional logic, such as the soundness and completeness theorems, can
be viewed as algebraic notions.
